# Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System built using data from Netflix, Amazon, and HBO. The project utilizes clustering techniques to recommend movies and TV series based on user preferences. Two implementations of the system are provided: one using Streamlit for a simple and interactive web application, and another using Flask API with an HTML front end. <br/>
<br/>

## Introduction
The Movie Recommendation System uses three datasets sourced from Kaggle, focusing on Netflix, Amazon, and HBO movies and TV series. The system leverages the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to group similar movies and provide recommendations based on user input. <br/>
<br/>

## Features
* Clustering with DBSCAN: Grouping of movies and TV series based on features to create clusters for recommendation.
* Streamlit Implementation: A user-friendly web interface for easy interaction with the recommendation system.
* Flask API Implementation: A robust backend system with a custom HTML front end for serving recommendations. <br/>
