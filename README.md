# Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System built using data from Netflix, Amazon, and HBO. The project utilizes clustering techniques to recommend movies and TV series based on user preferences. Two implementations of the system are provided: one using Streamlit for a simple and interactive web application, and another using Flask API with an HTML front end. <br/>
